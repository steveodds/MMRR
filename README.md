# MMRR
A WinUI 3.0 desktop app that generates proper CSVs/Excels of Mpesa statements that can be imported by budgeting apps

#Why?
A lot of budgeting apps are designed around financial statements provided by banks. Mpesa statements don't follow the typical format used and hence need to be restructured to be recognized by these apps.
This app deals with all that by consolidating charges into transactions, accounting for fuliza and mshwari, etc. A helper Android app will be added soon. The desktop app is still in alpha so you can either compile the app directly or request a compiled version from me.
